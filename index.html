                <h2>Labrador Retriever</h2>
                <p>The Labrador Retriever or Labrador is a British breed of retriever gun dog. It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the independent colony of Newfoundland (now part of Canada), and was named for the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the Western world.</p>  
                <aside>The Labrador is loyal, obedient and playful. It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog, but is widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.</aside>
